# WorkHub

A simplified Workhub ( Jira clone ) application with some custom modifications made with Next Js 14. This is a personal project for practicing skills and it is not intended to work as a real Jira application. It is still in early development and some features and improves are coming.

For pragmatic purposes, many features are not included. Others have been modified according to my tastes. The application should serve the basic functionalities of a project management software. I have taken inspiration from the actual [Jira website](https://www.atlassian.com/es/software/jira), as well as from [Trello](https://trello.com/). Also, [Ivor's Jira clone](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone) and [ducdv98 jira clone](https://github.com/ducdv98/jira-clone) has been a great inspiration for me. I only took ideas and resources (fonts and icons) from the original projects, all developments have being from scratch and by myself.

The app simulates Jira's workspace, where you can create projects, assign users and create and update issues.
